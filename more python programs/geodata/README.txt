Using the Google Places API with a Database and
Visualizing Data on Google Map

In this project, we are using the Google geocoding API
to clean up some user-entered geographic locations of
university names and then placing the data on a Google
Map.

Note: Windows has difficulty in displaying UTF-8 characters
in the console so for each command window you open, you may need
to type the following command before running this code:

    chcp 65001
